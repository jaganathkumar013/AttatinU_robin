1) In python, the size of float and integer is the same in terms of bytes then how is it able to store such large values?
Solution:-

2) How many bits are there in 1GB and 1MB?
 Solution:-
 1 GB=8*1024*1024*1024=8589934592,
 1 Mb=8000000 bits,
 (1 mb) + (1 gb) =8 008 000 000 bits

3)) write a program that takes input from the user as marks in 5 subjects and assigns a grade according to the following rules:
Perc = (s1+s2+s3+s4+s5)/5.
A, if Perc is 90 or more
B, if Perc is between 70 and 90(not equal to 90)
C, if Perc is between 50 and 70(not equal to 90)
D, if Perc is between 30 and 50(not equal to 90)
E, if Perc is less than 30


Solution:-
s1=float((input("Enter the maths mark ")))
s2=float((input("Enter the biology mark ")))
s3=float((input("Enter the chemitry mark ")))
s4=float((input("Enter the english mark ")))
s5=float((input("Enter the Accounts mark ")))

Perc = (s1+s2+s3+s4+s5)/5
if (Perc >= 90):
    print("A Grade")
elif Perc < 90 and Perc >= 70:
    print("B Grade")
elif Perc < 70 and Perc >= 50:
    print("C Grade")
elif Perc < 50 and Perc >= 30:
    print("D Grade")
elif Perc < 30:
    print("F Grade")

4)Build a very basic login system that takes in input from the username password. 
checks if username is "Priyesh" and password is "password" and responds with:
  Username Doesnot Exist
  Passwords donot match
  Entered the System
  
  Solution:-
    username=input("Enter the username ")
password=input('Enter the password ')
if username == 'Priyesh' and password == 'password':
    print ('Entered the System')
elif username !='Priyesh' :
    print  ('Username Doesnot Exist')
elif password !='password' :
    print  ('password donot match')
